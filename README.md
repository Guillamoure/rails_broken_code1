# Fix Chili's!

Chili's has designed a new website after their previous one was working too good. They hired a junior-junior developer to build it for them. However, after clicking around, they find that the entire code is broken!!

Chili's has hired you, a junior developer, to fix the bugs in this code from the previous developer. Their new website should:

* go to /customers to see all of the customers, and if you click on one, you should go to that individual customer's show page,

* go to /meals to see all of the menu items available on the Chili's menu, and if you click on one, you should go to that individual meal's show page,

* from a customer's show page, they should see all the meals they've eaten, plus all of the money they've spent and calories they've consumed, and a link make a new order, and a link to go back to the customer's index page,

* from a meal's show page, they should see all the details about a meal, plus a link to go back to the meal's index page,

* go to /meals/new to create a new meal for the menu,

* got to /customers/new to add a new customer to the Chili's family,

* go to /customer_meals/new to have a customer order a meal to eat.
